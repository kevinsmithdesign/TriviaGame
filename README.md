# TriviaGame

In this assignment I created an NFL Trivia game using JavaScript logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Rules Below:

• The Trivia game shows one question until the player answers or runs out of time.

• If the player guesses the correct answer they receive a trophy. If not, the NFL logo breaks on the page and shows the user     the answer was wrong. After a few seconds, the next question displays.

• If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Then, the next questions       appears.

• If the player chooses the wrong answer, the game tells the player they've selected the wrong option and shows a broken NFL     logo and displays the correct answer. 

• At the end of the game, you receive your results and the option to restart the game without reloading the page.
